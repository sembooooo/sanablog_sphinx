# My Dev experience in India [UnderConstruction]
This is regarding my experience as a software developer in India. During my experience i have asked few of my friends who work in other companies and they too were having similar experiences and questions.
This is just my experience and others experience might differ. These are the things which i felt during my 6.5 years of my career (True that its very less time)

## Work and Hike are two different
I joined the company as a fresher and i was being enthusiastic for work Initially. At some point of my career i stopped asking for work and started asking for money. I really miss those days where i only asked for work.
Work and Hike are two different things and one should ask for both.
### Performance does not matter 
After few years of joining the company my salary did not grew much. I was being payed half the amount what 
market was offering. I was in an illusion that my performance speaks for me but it was the biggest Genjutsu of my life.
If you perform better all you will be given is more work but not money.
### Your line manager powers are limited
I was told my by fellow colleagues that we need to ask our line managers for salary. I believed it as a selected few were getting good hikes. 
As they are a part of budget control I thought it might work. But end of the day they are just a part.
Here is the hierarchy

1. Team member
1. Team lead
1. manager for a group (comprises few teams)
1. manager for such managers
1. manager for the above managers 
1. managers for the above managers

hmmm now i understand that phrase "Managers managing managers" . I really do not understand the work people do who sit higher than my lead. They always tend to be in calls and nothing else.
So the manager of a group will get a few 10s of pay raise requests from multiple employees and now the manager has to contest with other group managers in front of his manager so he can give provide a good pay raise to the employees who work under him/her and be seen as a good manager. This contest goes on till the higher levels and finally somehow magically we end up not getting proper hikes. I used to blame my line manager for not giving me proper raise but after using some common sense i understood that they are power less too. 
The thing which people do not realize is even the manager for a group of teams also change companies when a proper hike is not given.

### Then why measure performance?  and how is hike even calculated ?
Performance measure has been the useless tool but not for managers.
This is how i see it. Performance measurement is taken to find out the candidates that work better and to overload those particular candidate. Now coming to how hike is calculated for a person, i have no freaking clue. This is one of my many unknown life mysteries.
When we ask our managers they point out to HRs and when we ask HRs they point to Managers. Its a while(1) loop.

### Main work and side work
