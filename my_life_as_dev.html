<h1>My Dev experience in India [UnderConstruction]<a class="headerlink" href="#my-dev-experience-in-india-underconstruction" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>This is regarding my experience as a software developer in India. During my experience i have asked few of my friends who work in other companies and they too were having similar experiences and questions.
This is just my experience and others experience might differ. These are the things which i felt during my 6.5 years of my career (True that its very less time)</p>

<h2>one cannot control everything in his life<a class="headerlink" href="#one-cannot-control-everything-in-his-life" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I work as an Automotive embedded engineer and when i was attending interviews i was asked why i choose Automotive domain. Previously i used to fake answers by telling that men love cars. Bloody even women love cars. Its a personal interest. Finally i one day i talked facts ” In India do we really have much of a choice to select the company and the job ?”
In India after companies hire us we are put in positions where there are vacancies and this has nothing to do with our skills.
Ask any fresher who is in a testing team how they ended up in testing. They will let you know in more detail.
If we are lucky we will end up in a good department , good product and good team. Thats all there is to it.
Just Luck!</p>

<h2>People faking things<a class="headerlink" href="#people-faking-things" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Initially when i started my career ,I  was put in a team which does documentation support and test support to our counter parts who stays outside India. All i did is open excel and few proprietary tools,everyday, which helps us in creating documents and nothing else. But during our department meetings i used to see different words such as “developing latest generation” , “maintaining current generation” etc.,. In reality we do not even know what we were doing. May be bad for branding.</p>

<h2>Genjutsu<a class="headerlink" href="#genjutsu" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>After few years of joining the company my salary did not grew much. I was being payed half the amount what
market was offering. I was in an illusion that my performance speaks for me but it was the biggest Genjutsu of my life.
If you perform better all you will be given is more work but not money.</p>

<h2>Not given until asked !<a class="headerlink" href="#not-given-until-asked" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I joined the company as a fresher and i was being enthusiastic for work Initially. At some point of my career i stopped asking for work and started asking for money. I really miss those days where i only asked for work.
Work and Hike are two different things and one should ask for both.</p>

<section id="even-gods-are-powerless-at-times">
<h2>Even Gods are powerless at times ..<a class="headerlink" href="#even-gods-are-powerless-at-times" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>I was told my by fellow colleagues that we need to ask our line managers for salary. I believed it as a selected few were getting good hikes.
As they are a part of budget control I thought it might work. When it comes to hikes managers are Gods. Only that god <strong>may</strong> help you in fulfilling your wish - a good hike not even LakshmiDevi Can do this. But end of the day they are just a part of a big chain.
Here is the hierarchy</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Team member</p></li>
<li><p>Team lead</p></li>
<li><p>manager for a group (comprises few teams)</p></li>
<li><p>manager for such managers</p></li>
<li><p>manager for the above managers</p></li>
<li><p>managers for the above managers</p></li>
</ol>
<p>hmmm now i understand that phrase “Managers managing managers” . I really do not understand the work people do who sit higher than my lead. They always tend to be in calls and nothing else.
So the manager of a group will get a few 10s of pay raise requests from multiple employees and now the manager has to contest with other group managers in front of his manager so he can give provide a good pay raise to the employees who work under him/her and be seen as a good manager. This contest goes on till the higher levels and finally somehow magically we end up not getting proper hikes. I used to blame my line manager for not giving me proper raise but after using some common sense i understood that they are power less too.
The thing which people do not realize is even the manager for a group of teams also change companies when a proper hike is not given.</p>

<h2>Performance measure - a tool to overload the talented/hardworking<a class="headerlink" href="#performance-measure-a-tool-to-overload-the-talented-hardworking" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Performance measure has been the useless tool but not for managers.
This is how i see it. Performance measurement is taken to find out the candidates that work better and to overload those particular candidate. Now coming to how hike is calculated for a person, i have no freaking clue. This is one of my many unknown life mysteries.
When we ask our managers they point out to HRs and when we ask HRs they point to Managers. Its a while(1) loop.</p>

<section id="good-managers-aka-the-lost-breed">
<h2>Good Managers aka The lost breed.<a class="headerlink" href="#good-managers-aka-the-lost-breed" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Apart from salary there are other things. I have worked under a bad manager and a good one. I am fortunate enough to spend quality time under the good manager and also fortunate enough to come out of my first team very quickly
Managers though being helpless in the pay topic at most of the times , they try to provide extensive support in other areas.
There are still managers</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>who don’t force their employees to work from office even when there is no need.</p></li>
<li><p>Who provide extensive support during some personal crisis</p></li>
<li><p>Who do not blame dev during escalations.</p></li>
<li><p>Who tries to provide a decent workload for their team members</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This list goes on. Unfortunately their efforts are not seen by many like me and they lack recognition in these areas. Some turn into pure managers -with boss mentality because of lack of appreciation after few years. The lost breed.</p>

<section id="main-work-side-work">
<h2>Main work- side work<a class="headerlink" href="#main-work-side-work" title="Permalink to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Most of the companies here in India have their headquarters in another country and the companies here try to outsource their employees to these locations. In other words Indian companies act as service providers to these locations. So there will be one major activity in which they provide their service and it for sure are not development activities. It a kind technical support/Configuration support /maintenance related activities. So the main focus is this work which brings in the budget and there will be few teams which will be doing minimal development. This development work will not grow even if people complain about it as the managers have difficult times bringing in new work packages from abroad. Also as the Indian companies do not care about employee retention ,the abroad also do not share additional development work packages as experience matters.
I previously did not understood when companies replace a 5  year experience with 2 freshers who are led by existing seniors but i think now i sort of do. They do not care about development until there are no bugs reported. Poor freshers.</p>

<p>After linkedin became the corporate instagram, i see so many activities and #tags recently than 5 years before.
Now its not what we do , it is what we show and i am not sure how long this will be on trend.</p>

<p>I do not even want to Enter into the training topic but i see freshers being trained in C language and C++ after joining the company which is not something which i would expect.
Also people who are recruited sometimes are asked programming questions and are later put in a team where coding is not even required. Then why ask coding to those guys ? To fool people that their job contains coding ?
Weird stuff.
Every team almost every time complains about the new joiners and every new joiner almost complains about training. A never ending cycle of curses.</p>
